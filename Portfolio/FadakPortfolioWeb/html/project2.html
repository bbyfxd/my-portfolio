            <h2>About Bloodbloom</h2>
            <p>
                Bloodbloom is a creepy and surreal 3D horror game I created with a team for a school project. It takes place in a strange, unsettling world ruled by a cult that worships a bloody flower god. The game blends horror with uncanny visuals and eerie sound design to create an atmosphere that constantly keeps the player on edge.

                The idea began with me and Diana, we wanted to push ourselves to make something eerie, creative, and weirdly fun. Thankfully, William joined in and made the process smoother, and we teamed up with a group of talented 3D design students: Kalle, Juho, Serhi, and Denys. Together, we brought this twisted vision to life.

            <p>
                Bloodbloom gave us the chance to dive into storytelling and visual atmosphere as a group. It was also a big first for me: my first time using Unity for 3D, collaborating through GitHub, and learning basic Blender skills. It challenged me in all the right ways and became one of the most memorable projects I’ve worked on.

            <h2>Development Notes</h2>
            <p>
                This project really pushed me to learn more about Unity’s 3D tools and Blender modeling, plus working as a team using GitHub was a whole new experience. It was my first time making a 3D horror game with a weird, creepy vibe, which was both challenging and fun.

                I helped come up with the game concept and story with my teammates, wrote lore and easter eggs, and made concept art and 2D UI stuff in Krita. I also coded the first person camera and player movement, and even designed and coded the ending credits with that classic Star Wars scrolling text look.

                Working with my talented friends and 3D artists was awesome we all shared ideas and helped build the strange world of the Bloodbloom Collective together. This project showed me how teamwork and creativity can really bring a weird, spooky game to life.
